# Levit

The core kit for building application logic with the Levit ecosystem. It bundles and re-exports the foundational packages for reactive state management, dependency injection, and utility mixins.

## Features

- **Dependency Injection**: Seamless scoping with [levit_scope](https://pub.dev/packages/levit_scope).
- **Core Abstractions**: Foundational building blocks from [levit_dart](https://pub.dev/packages/levit_dart).
